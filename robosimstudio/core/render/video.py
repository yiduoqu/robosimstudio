"""Streaming mp4 writers, one per camera.

A recorder that buffers frames until close costs memory proportional to the
episode and loses everything if the run dies, so :class:`VideoWriter` opens the
file on the first frame and appends, to an ``ffmpeg`` of its own that encodes
while the caller steps. ``imageio-ffmpeg`` is imported only for its binary, and
only when a first frame arrives.

Depth and segmentation are written as colourised previews, never as the data: an
mp4 is 8-bit and lossy, so those videos are for looking at. The metric array and
the label ids belong in the episode's ``npz``. The two colourisers live here
because a live view in a browser wants exactly the same conversion -- a channel
that is not ``rgb`` has to become ``rgb`` before anything can display it.

    while the simulation steps, and five cameras encode on five processes at
    once. It used to be imageio's writer, called inline, which held the stepping
    thread for the whole encode -- 3.8 s of a 20 s demo's 11.8 s for five

        queue: Frames that may wait for the encoder before :meth:`append`
            blocks, which is what bounds the memory a slow encoder can take.
        threads: Encoder threads, 0 for ffmpeg's own choice (about one and a

        copy: Copy each frame as it is queued. The encode happens later, so a
            caller that draws every frame into one buffer needs it; a caller
            whose every frame is a fresh array -- any renderer's -- can skip it.

    A writer dropped without :meth:`close` still finishes its file once it is
    collected, as imageio's did; :meth:`close` is what reports a failure.
